# Week 1: Setting up Git with RStudio

## Using Github & RStudio

The goal is to introduce you to R, RStudio, and how they function with github. We will probably cover a lot more than you can absorb, but mainly I hope to familiarize you to the landscape and tools, and then you'll begin to recognize the pieces as we start using them more regularly.

### RStudio Preferences <i class="fa fa-cog" aria-hidden="true"></i>

*<sub>What! You can use Icons?! More on that later...</sub>*

RStudio has a seemingly infinite number of combinations and settings, don't let it scare you! Ultimately you only need adjust what you need/use, and as you become more savvy you can begin changing more options.

 - Try looking at the `Tools > Global Options`
    - Where is your default R directory? <i class="fa fa-check-square" aria-hidden="true"></i>
    - Unclick "Restore .RData into workspace at startup" <i class="fa fa-check-square" aria-hidden="true"></i>
    - Look on the left hand side for Pane Layout...adjust to your preference

### RMarkdown Documents  <i class="fa fa-file-text" aria-hidden="true"></i>

You can customize these to your heart's content. Many options, styles, etc. What's really neat is you can create slide presentations, apps, reports, even books, using RMarkdown documents. The only thing that gets changed around (for the most part) is the `yaml` header at the top (the section delineated with a `---` at the start and end). So once you learn some basics, you can do a lot!
