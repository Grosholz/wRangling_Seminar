# WEEK 1

## Using Github & RStudio

The goal is to introduce you to R, RStudio, and how they function with github. We will probably cover a lot more than you can absorb, but mainly I hope to familiarize you to the landscape and tools, and then you'll begin to recognize the pieces as we start using them more regularly.

### RStudio Preferences <i class="fa fa-cog" aria-hidden="true"></i>

*<sub>What! You can use Icons?! More on that later...</sub>*

RStudio has a seemingly infinite number of combinations and settings, don't let it scare you! Ultimately you only need adjust what you need/use, and as you become more savvy you can begin changing more options.

 - Try looking at the `Tools > Global Options`
    - Where is your default R directory? <i class="fa fa-check-square" aria-hidden="true"></i>
    - Unclick "Restore .RData into workspace at startup" <i class="fa fa-check-square" aria-hidden="true"></i>
    - Look on the left hand side for Pane Layout...adjust to your preference


### RMarkdown Documents  <i class="fa fa-file-text" aria-hidden="true"></i>

You can customize these to your heart's content. Many options, styles, etc. What's really neat is you can create slide presentations, apps, reports, even books, using RMarkdown documents. The only thing that gets changed around (for the most part) is the `yaml` header at the top (the section delineated with a `---` at the start and end). So once you learn some basics, you can do a lot!

 > See here for more info: (http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/index.html)
 
The lines at the top of this *Rmd* file are setting the global code chunk options. If you want, you could load packages here, but probably not advised because the setup chunk won't show up in the document (it's hidden using `include=FALSE`).

```{r eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}

knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = FALSE, warning=FALSE)
knitr::opts_knit$set(root.dir = normalizePath("../"))
htmltools::tagList(rmarkdown::html_dependency_font_awesome())

```

The second and third lines (`knitr::opts_knit` and `htmltools`) are doing the following.

 - `normalizePath` is a way to tell the Rmarkdown `knitr` to look for files *up* one directory, assuming your Rmd is saved in a documents folder inside the root directory.
 - `htmltools` is just a fun tool to add little graphic icons (like this <i class="fa fa-fire" aria-hidden="true"></i>).

# WEEK 2:

## Using lists or vectors of characters

```{r data objects, echo=TRUE}

# Entering Data Objects ---------------------------------------------------

weight_kg <- 55    # doesn't print anything
(weight_kg <- 55)  # but putting parenthesis around the call prints the value of `weight_kg`
weight_kg          # and so does typing the name of the object

weight_kg <- 57.5

2.2 * weight_kg

weight_lb <- 2.2 * weight_kg

weight_kg <- 100

# Vectors & Datatypes -----------------------------------------------------

# numeric

weight_g <- c(50, 60, 65, 82)
weight_g
summary(weight_g)

# character

## THIS WON'T WORK:
# 1animals <- c("mouse", "rat", "dog", "cat") # can't start variable name with a number

animals <- c("mouse", "rat", "dog", "cat") # can't start variable name with a number
summary(animals)
# factors
named_variable <- as.factor(c("mouse", "rat", "dog", "cat"))

# Looking at our data
str(named_variable)
class(named_variable)
summary(named_variable)

weight_g <- c(weight_g, 90) # adding at the end of the vector
weight_g <- c(30, weight_g) # adding at the beginning of the vector
weight_g

# Data Classes ------------------------------------------------------------

# What will these be?
num_char <- c(1, 2, 3, 'a') # character wins over numeric


num_logical <- c(1, 2, 3, FALSE)
char_logical <- c('a', 'b', 'c', TRUE)
tricky <- c(1, 2, 3, '4')


# Subsetting --------------------------------------------------------------

animals <- c("mouse", "rat", "dog", "cat")

animals[ c(1, 2:4, 4) ]

named_variable[2]

weight_g[4]

# Conditional subsetting
weight_g <- c(21, 34, 39, 54, 55)
weight_g[c(TRUE, FALSE, TRUE, TRUE, FALSE)]

weight_g > 50    # will return logicals with TRUE for the indices that meet the condition

## so we can use this to select only the values above 50
weight_g[weight_g > 50]

## Combine with using & (AND) or | (OR)
weight_g[weight_g < 30 | weight_g > 50]

weight_g[weight_g < 30 & weight_g > 50]

weight_g[weight_g >= 30 | weight_g == 21]


# ADVANCED Subsetting -----------------------------------------------------

animals <- c("mouse", "rat", "dog", "cat")
animals[animals == "cat" | animals == "rat"] # returns both rat and cat

# tedious typing...so let's try the function %in%

animals %in% c("rat", "cat", "dog", "duck")

animals[animals %in% c("rat", "cat", "dog", "duck")]


## Challenge: Why does "four" > "five" returns TRUE?

# Missing Data and NA -----------------------------------------------------

planets <- c("Mercury", "Venus", "Earth", "Mars", "Jupiter", "Saturn", "Uranus", "Neptune", NA)

heights <- c(2, 4, 4, NA, 6)

mean(heights)
max(heights)
mean(heights, na.rm = TRUE)
max(heights, na.rm = TRUE)


# extract elements that are not missing values
heights[ !is.na(heights) ]

# make a new vector with no NAs 
planet_no_NA <- planets[ !is.na(planets)]

# using function na.omit:
na.omit(heights)

# extract elements that are complete cases
heights[complete.cases(heights)]


## Challenge

sample <- c(2, 4, 4, "NA", 6)
mean(sample, na.rm = TRUE)

# so we need to convert to numeric:
sample_num <- as.numeric(sample)
mean(sample_num, na.rm = TRUE)
```


```{r vectors, echo=TRUE}


# Make a vector of names
firstnames <- c("Ryan", "Sue", "John", "Rachel")
firstnames

str(firstnames)  # tells you structure of data

# make a vector of animals
animals <- c('cat', "dog", 'rat', 'mouse')
animals

# combine vectors
biglist <- c(firstnames, animals)

biglist

# Make a vector of numbers

lista <- c(1, 2, 5, 8, 11, NA, 15)
lista
str(lista)

# find out length of vector
length(lista)

# summarizes data based on type
summary(lista)
summary(biglist)

# A function
mean(x=lista, na.rm = TRUE) # remember you can use tab to autocomplete

# Working with NAs --------------------------------------------------------

is.na(lista) #TRUE/FALSE list of all NAs

lista[6] # accessing 6 item in the vector
lista_noNA <- lista[!is.na(lista)]

length(lista_noNA)

lista[6] <- 0
lista

rm(lista_noNA) # remove this object from your environment

# Sequence ---------------------------------------------------------------

seq(1,10, by=1)
seq(5,10, length.out = 3) # it calculates values of breaks/intervals for you
seq(1, 8, by=3)
oneK<-seq(1000, 34000, by=1000)

# can use this to subset to the 1000, 2000 ... rows
# DATA[oneK,] 


```

A few notes, remember to assign objects (these can be lists, vectors, dataframe, functions) to your environment using `<-`.

Where possible, comment liberally. Also for clean coding a few tips:  

 - add spaces between assignments
 - after commas
 - never before parantheses or brackets


## Reading in some data and exploring dataframes

So we've worked with single "lists" or "vectors" of data above. If we chain those together we can create a dataframe, which is a rectangular vector with rows and columns. 

```{r working with dataframes, echo=TRUE, comment=TRUE}
# Reading in Data ---------------------------------------------------------

#download.file(url = "https://ndownloader.figshare.com/files/2292169", destfile = "data/portal_data_joined.csv")

# make sure you look at where the "destfile" path is, that's where file goes.

# read in the csv file, notice the relative path
surveys <- read.csv('data/portal_data_joined.csv')

# look at the top/bottom lines of the data
head(surveys)
tail(surveys)
summary(surveys) # look at summary of data
str(surveys) # look at structure of data

# to access a single column by name within a dataframe, use the "$"
summary(surveys$species_id)
levels(surveys$species_id)

# see the dimensions of the data...dataframes are listed as: row, column
dim(surveys)
dim(surveys)[2] # see only the total number of colummns in data

# brackets allow accessing a specific row or column
surveys[10,] # only row 10, all columns (because it's blank)

summary(surveys[,4]) # pull summary of specific column
summary(surveys$year) # same as above but by name


# FILTER DATA TO A GIVEN YEAR ---------------------------------------------

# we can filter data as we like, even chaining these together.
dat1977 <- surveys[surveys$year==1977, ] # filter only rows that have year=1977.

# only rows with year==1977 AND that have hindfoot length > 30
dat_filter_example1 <- surveys[surveys$year==1977 & surveys$hindfoot_length > 30, ] 

# only rows with year==1977 OR year==1987
dat_filter_example2 <- surveys[surveys$year==1977 | surveys$year==1997, ] 

# ok, lets make a  barplotplot
barplot(height = dat1977$hindfoot_length)


# make a point plot
plot(x = dat1977$hindfoot_length, y = dat1977$weight, pch=21, bg="maroon")


```

Many options for plotting parameters (changing colors, shapes, etc). Really sky is the limit. TO read more on playing with these parameters, please check out:

# WEEK 3

Revisiting data classes and types.

## Data Classes

Let's review the data classes we discussed previously. Remember the heirarchy of stuff in R:

 - **PACKAGES** (which are libraries of functions)
 - **_Libraries_** (collections of functions that do things)
 - *Functions* (something that takes *arguments* which use data/info)
    - DATATYPES:
        - *numeric*
        - *integer*
        - *factor*
        - *character*
        - *dates*
        - *logical/boolean (TRUE/FALSE)*

```{r data classes, echo=T, eval=T}

# talking data classes

mixed_vector <- c(2, 4.56, TRUE)
animals <- c("cat","dog", "parrot", "frog")
animals <- as.factor(animals)

(medicine <- c("control", "a", "b", "c", "d"))
medicine <- as.factor(medicine) # way to convert to a given 


(medicine <- factor(x = c("control", "a", "b", "c", "d"), levels = c("a", "b", "c", "d", "control")))

```

## Working With `dplyr`

Make sure you have the package installed, then load it using the `library()` function.

```{r echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("dplyr")
library(dplyr)

dplyr::select() # run a single function without loading a library, also helps if there's conflicting functions (i.e, same function name)

```

### 5 major verbs in dplyr: 

 - **`select`**
 - **`filter`**
 - **`mutate`**
 - **`group_by`**
 - **`summarize`**

#### Working with Select

**Challenge**:

Read in the data using `read.csv`, see how many columns, and what types of data. Name this object as "`shrubs`".

```{r select, eval=TRUE, echo=TRUE}

library(dplyr, warn.conflicts = F)
## notice you may need to add the leading `../`
#shrubs <- read.csv("../data/shrub-volume-experiment.csv")
shrubs <- read.csv("data/shrub-volume-experiment.csv")

str(shrubs)
dim(shrubs)
summary(shrubs)
head(shrubs)
tail(shrubs)
ncol(shrubs)
nrow(shrubs)

names(shrubs)

shrubs$site
shrubs[,1]

# using dplyr::select

select(shrubs, site, length)
select(shrubs, 1:3)
select(shrubs, site, ends_with("h"))
select(shrubs, site, contains("d"))

data_to_use <- select(shrubs, site, experiment, height)
# write.csv(data_to_use, file = "data_output/shrub_heights.csv", row.names = FALSE)

```

### Using `filter`

```{r filter, echo=TRUE, eval=TRUE}

filter(shrubs, height > 3)
filter(shrubs, width >= 2 & height > 3) # AND, must meet both conditions

# using OR
filter(shrubs, width >=2 | height > 3) # OR, can match either, but not necessarily both

```

### Pipes **`%>%`**

`dplyr` uses a package called [`magrittr`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/magrittr/vignettes/magrittr.html) which uses pipes.

```{r pipes, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}

select(shrubs, site:width) %>% 
  filter(length > 3, width > 2) %>% 
  write.csv("data_output/demo_pipe.csv", row.names=FALSE)

```


# WEEK 4

More `dplyr`! Today we'll quickly go over the first couple verbs from last week, and move forward with `mutate`, `group_by`, `summarize` and `arrange`. We will also over joins using the `dplyr` package.

```{r get data, eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}

# data we'll be using, you should already have it
download.file("https://ndownloader.figshare.com/files/2292169",
              "data/portal_data_joined.csv")


```

We'll be using the `dplyr` and `nycflights13` packages, load them here (or `install.packges`) if needed.

```{r}
library(dplyr)
library(nycflights13)

# surveys <- read.csv('../data/portal_data_joined.csv')
surveys <- read.csv('data/portal_data_joined.csv')


```

Covered `select` & `filter`:

 - can select columns by names, attributes
 - filter by rows, can filter by values
 
```{r select and filter, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}

select(surveys, plot_id, species_id, weight)
filter(surveys, year == 1995)

```

Remember the shortcut for the pipe is "*Ctrl or Cmd + Shift + M*"

```{r pipes2, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}

surveys %>%
  select(species_id, sex, weight) %>% 
  filter(weight < 5)

surveys_sml <- surveys %>%
  select(species_id, sex, weight) %>% 
  filter(weight < 5)

```

### Mutate

```{r mutate, echo=TRUE}

surveys %>% 
  mutate(weight_kg = weight / 1000) %>% 
  glimpse

# filter out NA's from weight data

surveys %>% 
  filter(!is.na(weight)) %>% 
  mutate(weight_kg = weight / 1000) %>% 
  summary

hindfoothalf <- surveys %>%
  mutate(hindfoot_half = hindfoot_length / 2 ) %>% 
  select(species_id, hindfoot_half) %>% 
  filter(!is.na(hindfoot_half) & hindfoot_half < 30)
  
hindfoothalf <- surveys %>%
  select(species_id, hindfoot_length) %>% 
  mutate(hindfoot_half = hindfoot_length / 2 ) %>% 
  select(species_id, hindfoot_half) %>% 
  filter(!is.na(hindfoot_half) & hindfoot_half < 30)

```

#### Another Challenge

**What was the heaviest animal measured in each year? Return the columns year, genus, species_id, and weight.**

Okay, break this out into pieces...how do we get the heaviest animal in each year? 

```{r surveys}

surveys %>% 
  filter(!is.na(weight)) %>% # filter out NAs
  group_by(year) %>%  # group by year
  top_n(1, weight) %>% 
  select(year, species_id, weight) %>% 
  arrange(year)

```

### Group_by and Summarize

```{r group_by}

weight_by_sex <- surveys %>%
  group_by(sex) %>%
  summarize(mean_weight = mean(weight, na.rm = TRUE))

surveys %>%
  filter(!is.na(weight) & sex != "") %>%
  group_by(sex, species_id) %>%
  summarize(mean_weight = mean(weight))

```

```{r tally}

tallies <- surveys %>% 
  group_by(species_id, sex) %>% 
  filter(sex != "") %>% 
  tally
```

### Data Tidying

```{r surveys complete, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
surveys_complete <- surveys %>%
  filter(species_id != "",         # remove missing species_id
         !is.na(weight),           # remove missing weight
         !is.na(hindfoot_length),  # remove missing hindfoot_length
         sex != "")      


## Extract the most common species_id
species_counts <- surveys_complete %>%
  group_by(species_id) %>%
  tally %>%
  filter(n >= 50)


surveys_complete_2 <- surveys_complete %>%
  filter(species_id %in% species_counts$species_id)

surveys_complete_2 %>% 
  group_by(species_id) %>% 
  distinct()

write.csv(surveys_complete_2, file = "data_output/surveys_complete.csv",
          row.names=FALSE)

```

### Joins

Following this lesson:

**https://ismayc.github.io/moderndiver-book/5-manip.html#joining-data-frames**

```{r joins}
library(nycflights13)

View(airlines)

flights_joined <- flights %>% 
  inner_join(airlines, by="carrier")

# compare columns to make sure they joined
dim(flights)
dim(flights_joined)

flights %>% 
  inner_join(airports, by = c("dest" = "faa"))


named_dests <- flights %>%
  group_by(dest) %>%
  summarize(num_flights = n()) %>% 
  arrange(desc(num_flights)) %>% 
  inner_join(airports, by = c("dest" = "faa")) %>% 
  rename(airport_name = name)

# write.csv

```
